# Future Work

When I was testing my program I noticed that I need to make some adjustments to improve it.Here are some improvements to do:


- Separating my code into different classes to avoid so much code in one class
- Add a User Interface by making my app and Android Application
- Reduce code redundancy using advanced functions and methods
